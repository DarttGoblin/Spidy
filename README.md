Spidy ‚Äì Your Web-Weaving Portfolio Assistant üï∑Ô∏è

Hi there! Welcome to Spidy, a friendly AI assistant that knows all about my portfolio and is ready to answer your questions about my projects, experiences, skills, and more. Think of Spidy as a little spider that helps connect the web of my work! üï∏Ô∏è

Features

Ask about my projects, work experience, skills, education, or hobbies.
Answers are generated using Google Gemini AI for natural, conversational responses.
Lightweight Flask server with a React frontend for smooth interaction.
CORS-ready so you can easily integrate it into a local or remote frontend.

Notes

The AI model used is Gemini-2.5-Flash via Google Generative AI.
Currently, the server is synchronous, so responses may take a few seconds.
For development, all origins are allowed via CORS. For production, restrict origins as needed.
